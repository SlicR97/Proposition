The last job involved the group around Hastings. It was given by an old jeweller who had recently acquired a unique ring. However, just a few weeks after obtaining it, the man found his Jewellery broken into and the ring stolen.
The job eventually lead the group to a cult that had devoted itself to summoning The Old One; they had stolen the ring as it is said that it was given to the world by the deity itself and could be used to summon it.
When the group arrived to stop the ritual, things escalated: Instead of a small group of religious devotees, they found a heavily armed militia guarding the priests that conducted the ritual. Eventually, they managed to get through and (in their perception) stop the ritual, but the lost Montana on that day. The ritual, however, had already mostly been completed, opening the world to The Old One. He is not yet powerful enough do exert his will, but his spirit is nesting inside this world, ready to grab an unsuspecting victim and lead it to completing the ritual.
After the group had dealt with the first shock of losing a valued member, they started securing and searching the scene; gathering evidence, searching the bodies, the usual. The ring, however, was gone. Nobody knew where it had vanished to, and with a job only halfway done, the group disbanded disappointedly.
