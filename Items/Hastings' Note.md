Hastings,

Attached to this letter I send you the payment for the last job. Since it proved quite difficult to locate you, I left it here at the range for you to pick up. I deducted $30 courtesy of the bodies you guys left behind. I really expected better from a decorated soldier.

Regards,
A

P.S.
I would suggest you keep your head down for a while; your group has stirred up something in the underbelly of this city. I don't yet know what, but I'll keep researching. If you want to find out more yourself, maybe try talking to the Rat.
