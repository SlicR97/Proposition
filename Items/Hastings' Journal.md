#Hastings #Handout 

## September 13: 
Gotta pay more attention. Today, my note almost fell out of my boot during a meeting with a potential client. If they had seen that, I could've waved the job goodbye.

## October 21:
Got to spend some more time with Mable today. We tried not to talk too much about work, but a little still slips in every here and there. We're both not too thrilled about the next job, but pay's well. Pay's always well when dealing with juwellers. Anyway. In times like these, she is really the rock I can lean on. Even more so now, since she has her own office at [[The Arkham Gazette]] where we can have some time together without anyone disturbing us.

## December 1:
Alright, tomorrow's the job. I'm not too comfortable with breaking into a church but hey, the cultists did it first, so we're in the right, right? Anyway, I'll try not to splatter too much blood on the icons.

## December 19:
Finally followed up on Armitage's advice and visited Mike's to talk to the contact. Didn't have too much to reveal, just talked lots about [[The One Eye]]. Only after reminding him of his debt to Armitage though. Nothing I wouldn't have known anyway though.
