#Handout 

"
Zh,

I have heard many a tale about you. A young, successful detective, having solved some truly perplexing crimes; However, it seems that your stream of clients has dried up somewhat. Might I perchance be the one who's behind this? Anyway, I thought I would give you something to do with all this spare time you have on your hands right now: Attached to this letter is a little puzzle box of my making, and with it comes a challenge. Some people, trying to disturb a certain ritual, seem to have passed away under mysterious circumstances as of recent. I want you to seek out the place where these deaths have happened, as the perpetrator has left a single letter at each of these places, which, when aligned correctly, can be used to open this very box - a scavenger hunt, if you will. I won't give you too many tips, most of it should be straightforward anyways. I eagerly await you at the place these deaths will inevitably lead you.

Yours truly,
G

P.S. I think you might want to visit the local gun range first.
P.P.S A handsome reward awaits you when we will meet.
