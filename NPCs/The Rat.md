Male, about 75, rat-like in appearance.
One of the informants about the criminal underworld.
Can reveal some details about [[The One Eye]], but only if either bribed or pressed with some incriminating evidence.
Will offer to give information for 50$.

Information given:
The group around [[William Hastings]] had been tasked by some jeweller backed by [[Armitage]] to retrieve a ring that had been stolen from him. The ring had been stolen by [[The One Eye]] and was to be used to resurrect some old deity. The group's intervention inhibited the cult's efforts, but didn't stop them outright. 
He also mentions that he does not know the exact location of the cult, but that it is being led by some [[Father Gascoigne]].
