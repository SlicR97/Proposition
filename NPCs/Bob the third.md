- Good friend of [[William Hastings]]
- Primary witness (Discovered the body when he entered the range at about 5pm)
- When pressed, he will reveal the location of [[Hastings' Note]]
- A DC 15 persuasion check will also make him reveal the following: Shortly before [[William Hastings]]' death, he heard shouting from the range. Apparently, [[William Hastings]] had threatened the other customers at the range at gunpoint, forcing them to leave. When left alone, a few minutes passed, then Bob had heard another single shot, then silence. When he entered the shooting grounds, he saw [[William Hastings]] on the ground, in the composition described in [[Arkham Gun Range]]
