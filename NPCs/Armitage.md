Armitage is a busy, stressed man. When the player seeks him out at his office he is tight-lipped and rough. He is visibly frustrated with something. 

- If the player inquires about [[The Last Job]], he will open up a little and spill some of the details in frustration. 
- If the player tells him about the voice they've been hearing, he will tell them about [[The Outer One]]
- If the player has encountered two or more of the former PCs, he will tell them about [[Konrad Heldenhammer]] and [[Berty McDonald]], since he hasn't heard from them in a while.
- If the player inquires about [[Hastings' Note]], he will tell them about the rat and how to pressure him into giving out information.

Generally, Armitage will not share any information unless the player directly inquires him about that information.
