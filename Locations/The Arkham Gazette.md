#Parker-Green 

- Biggest newspaper company in Arkham
- Employer of [[Mable Parker-Green]]

## The Murder
[[Mable Parker-Green]] was discovered at around 06:30 in her office, after the first workers entered the Gazette in the morning. She had apparently been writing furiously in her notebook, before gouging her own eyes out with her office pen and bleeding to death. 

## The Employees
The employees of the Gazette have been given strict instructions not to let anything slip about the death. They will let [[Nika "The Bow" Zh]] in, but will try not to reveal anything to her. When pressed, one might let slip that Parker-Green had a visitor yesterday, but not who that was. When confronted with the name "McDonald", one might reveal that this name refers to [[Berty McDonald]].

## [[Mable Parker-Green]]'s Office
Her office is divided into several parts that can be investigated by [[Nika "The Bow" Zh]]:

### The Body
When searching the body, [[Nika "The Bow" Zh]] can discover [[Mable Parker-Green]]'s purse. In it is a picture of [[William Hastings]]. No other information can be gained from this.
A DC 12 investigation check also reveals her planner. The only useful information is that she met with someone going by the name of "McDonald" yesterday at 6pm.

### The Desk
Her desk is generally tidied up, apart from the blood splatters and the strangely scribbled note. It is decorated with a few pictures of family members, a pencil opener, and other usual office supplies. Searching through the drawers will reveal a heap of paper, mostly unsorted. A DC10 investigation check will reveal a dossier on [[The Last Job]], indicating at least the street at which the final showdown had occurred: East Church Street.

### The Couch
The couch is small, but luxurious. Two people can sit on it. On the table before the couch stand two cups, both about 20% filled with ice-cold coffee.

### The Painting
The painting is stuck to the wall, apparently with adhesive. It can be ripped off with a successful DC8 Acrobatics check, or a DC12 perception check back at the desk can reveal the location of the switch used to electronically open it up. Behind the painting, [[Nika "The Bow" Zh]] will find [[The Underworld Contacts]], a phone book filled with Parker-Greens most private contacts, mostly from the underworld.

### The Cupboards
The cupboards of Parker-Greens office are decorated with several trophies and awards for journalistic work. A DC 15 perception check reveals a spot of dried-up blood on one of the trophies.
