Hastings' flat is Spartan, only filled with what's most necessary. A desk, a bed, a wardrobe, that's about it. The only visible decoration is the large american flag over the bed, flanked by two guns.

## Wardrobe
The wardrobe is organised neatly. Filled with copies of mostly the same jackets, trousers, and so on. However, one of the jackets has a dried-up bloodstain on it. A closer look reveals a small phonebook in the inside of the jacket.

## Desk
The desk is the only thing in the flat that indicates a human ever lived here. It is cluttered with all sorts of things, from loose notes over dollar bills up to his journal.
There is nothing of great interest among the notes, mostly invoices or advertisements, but having a closer look at the journal might reveal a few things with an investigation check:
- 5+: the location of Hastings' note is revealed
- 10+: The address of Parker-Green is revealed
- 15+: Details about the last job are revealed
- 20+: The name of the Rat is revealed
