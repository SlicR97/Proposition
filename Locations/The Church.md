The church is the final step in Zh's scavenger hunt. It is comprised of the entrance, a main chamber, a back chamber, and the catacombs.

## The Entrance
At the entrance, a guard will stop all people not specifically approved to enter. They will ask for a passphrase, which the adventurer may find during their travels. The adventurer can use the passphrase, try to bribe the guard, or use physical force to make their way inside.

## The Main Chamber
The main chamber of the church is a large room filled with church benches and an altar at the far end. Some more cultists reside here. If the player used force to enter, they will attack directly; if the player bribed the guard, the cultists will only attack when the player tries to enter the back chamber.

## The Back Chamber
This is the room [[Father Gascoigne]] resides in. He is sitting in a chair, patiently awaiting the player's entrance. (For more information, see his page).

## The Catacombs
The catacombs of the church are dank and only lit by the torch [[Father Gascoigne]] hands the player. They consist of a system of tunnels, but the player will be lead to the first room to the right. Inside the room, they will see the dead remains of Johnny "Zitronendrops" Montana, propped up in an X-shape, his mouth stuffed with Zitronendrops. Next to the corpse is a small table on which the [[Combination]] can be found.
