#Hastings 

The Arkham Gun Range is the main meeting point of various gun-related groups, as well as a few people interested in firearms. It is maintained by [[Bob the third]] and generally in good condition.

## Murder
Recently, the range has become the scene of a gruesome murder. [[William Hastings]] has been found dead after practicing at the rage alone, presumably having killed himself.
What's peculiar about the death is that his gun was found a few meters away. Theories have been made about it ricocheting away when he pulled the trigger, but the evidence for this is circumstantial at best. What is also strange is the circle of guns arranged around his dead body.
Nobody can say for certain since he had been alone when the event happened. This is in itself unusual, since he had booked a spot in the range on a Saturday from 1 to 3pm, usually a favored time for the other groups.
(DM note: When [[Nika "The Bow" Zh]] investigates the gun range, she will hear the voice of [[The Outer One]] for the first time).
