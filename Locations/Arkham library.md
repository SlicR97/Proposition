The Arkham library is a massive, ancient building, home to thousands, if not tens of thousands of books, and the primary workplace of [[Berty McDonald]]. When the player first enters the library, a loud crashing of glass can be heard, as the lifeless body of [[Berty McDonald]] drops from one of the higher floors onto the marble floor of the library, cracking his skull in the process.

## The Body
When examining the body, it becomes apparent quickly that the brain has been removed. Instead, upon cracking open the skull of the victim, the player will find a note with the letter "B" written on it.

## The Office
The office of [[Berty McDonald]] is not decorated luxuriously. Apart from a desk, there are a few pictures on the walls, but that is about it. When examining the desk, the player makes a DC10 investigation check and, depending on the results, finds the following:
- 10+: A picture of [[Berty McDonald]] and [[Konrad Heldenhammer]]. Upon closer inspection, that picture has a text written on its backside: "McDonald and Heldenhammer at the Paraxis, 1918"
- 15+: [[Berty McDonald's Note]]
There is also a vase propped up on the table. If the player decides to look inside it, they will find the [[Passphrase]].
