#Heldenhammer

Praxis of [[Konrad Heldenhammer]]

- The front door is heavily fortified, no getting in through there
- On the back there is another door. This one is also closed, but could be opened by some strong force (e.g. gunshot)
- A DC10 perception check will reveal an open window on the second floor. This can be reached by climbing up (DC9 acrobatics check)

## Heldenhammer's office
The office is messy, books strewn about everywhere. However, the one thing that instantly catches the eye is the body of Heldenhammer itself. The walls of the office are plastered with shelves, each filled to the brim with books. On the rare spots that are not covered by shelves are preserved carcasses of god-knows-what.

### The Body
The body has been disfigured grotesquely. Eyes, ears, and nose have been removed, and in their places, tongues have been attached with surgical precision. The body carries nothing but its wallet, filled with 30$. The mouth of the corpse has been sewn shut, but if the player opens it, they will se a "C" branded into Heldenhammer's tongue.

## The Desk
On the desk, the player can find Heldenhammers contact book with relative ease. The player will obtain [[Heldenhammer's Contacts]].

## The shelves
The shelves are covered with books, not organized at all, about the most different of topics. A DC10 perception check will reveal a note tucked in between the books. The player will obtain [[Heldenhammer's Note]].
