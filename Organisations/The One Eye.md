The One Eye is an ancient cult devoted to resurrecting [[The Outer One]]. They have gone to great lengths to achieve this feat, infiltrating the church on East Church Street and slowly turning it into their headquarters.

They recently almost managed to complete their ritual, were however interrupted by [[William Hastings]] and the rest of his group. Many were killed, but one managed to flee with the ring into which the soul of [[The Outer One]] had been bound successfully by then. The last step was to find a suitable wearer who would dedicate their soul the [[The Outer One]] for all eternity.
